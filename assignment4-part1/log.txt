Tasks: Quickly realized that I needed to set up a server to interpret PHP code. I downloaded XAMPP, figured out how to open files using the localhost, where files need to be (by default) in order to use XAMPP in Chrome. After that, I was able to create a simple PHP file that passed values by GET and put the keys and values into a table.

Tasks: Finished the multtable.php file portion of assignment. Spent the majority of the time validating the input to ensure values would work in a multiplication table. Creation of the multiplication table took around 30 minutes.

Tasks: Cleaned up multtable.php file for submission. Completed the loopback.php file, uploaded to GitHub repository. Completed the login.php portion of the assignment. The most difficult part of this portion was guarding the content pages from someone that wasn't logged in. This portion made me like and respect PHP a lot more. The sessions became very intuitive a lot faster than I was expecting, given how foreign they felt during the lecture.
